            <h1>-About me</h1>
            <p>Hello, I'm Cha and I'm a web developer who is just starting off. To learn everything I can about web programming, from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and beyond, I recently joined in a bootcamp  Which is Kodego. I'm passionate about building engaging websites that serve users' needs, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me. I enjoy learning from others in the web development community and experimenting with various web development tools and frameworks in my leisure time. I'm excited to put my skills to use developing cutting-edge web solutions and having a good influence in the digital world.</p>
